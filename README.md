# rtb-android-client

Raise the Bar was a hackathon-begun initiative to make the gym experience more wholesome and induvidualized. At its very core, it was an attempt to allow users to be able to get feedback on their form when lifting weights. It eventually evolved into a IOT concept wherein a user would be able to connect to various different machines using the Texas Instruments Sensor Tag and be able to track their form and overall athleticism.
